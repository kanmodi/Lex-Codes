# Lex Codes

Lex is a computer program that generates lexical analyzers ("scanners" or "lexers").

Lex is commonly used with the yacc parser generator. Lex, originally written by Mike Lesk and Eric Schmidt and described in 1975, is the standard lexical analyzer generator on many Unix systems, and an equivalent tool is specified as part of the POSIX standard.

This repository contains example programs for Lex to run a lexical analyser. Follow the instructions in the following link to download the Lex software and run programs - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI-jwky_mqM
